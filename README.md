# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This is my version of the project, built as part of the Lighthouse Labs bootcamp from a repository of starter code. My work focused on the front-end, using HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX.

Features of this version of Tweeter include a character counter that turns red when it goes over, a nav bar button that jumps to the "write Tweet" field, and responsive design that includes a desktop layout and a tablet layout that can handle all but the tiniest screens. 

Tweeter will assign your tweets to random profiles that will populate your feed. Be your own best friends!

Tweeter is Cross-Site Scripting safe.
