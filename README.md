# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This is my version of the project, built as part of the Lighthouse Labs bootcamp from a repository of starter code. My work focused on the front-end, using HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX.

Features of this version of Tweeter include a character counter that turns red when it goes over, a nav bar button that jumps to the "write Tweet" field, and responsive design that includes a desktop layout and a tablet layout that can handle all but the tiniest screens. 

Tweeter will assign your tweets to random profiles that will populate your feed. Be your own best friends!

And - sorry Harold! - Tweeter is Cross-Site Scripting safe.
